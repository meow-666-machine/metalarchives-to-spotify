# metalarchives-to-spotify
Does your cat make tooo muchh noisee?

Try this repo! This will (lightly) crawl the metalarchives advanced search results and save them to an sqlite database. The second script will use the spotify api and the database to search and add (if able) albums to an auto generated playlist. Playlists are capped to 1000 songs per playlist and will be distributed evenly.

## Requires
Python
Selenium
Firefox
Firefox-Geckodriver

This can be run on Windows and Linux (and maybe mac but I have no clue).
